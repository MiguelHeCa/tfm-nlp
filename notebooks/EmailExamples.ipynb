I need the following four issues resolved to complete their tax returns. If you are not the correct accountant(s), could you please tell me who is? I would appreciate this information by Friday, April 27.\n",

      "It appears that on November 3, 2000 Co. 214 sold its 100% interest in Co. 218 (Citadel Venezolana, S.A.) to Co. 102 for 8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars. (If you need documentation for your research, I have the interoffice memo concerning this transaction.) There are four issues I have with this transaction:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 still has an Investment in Subsidiary balance of $1,760,000 and Equity Earnings of $494,508.83 relating to Co. 218. Should not these balances be $0? Also would there have been an intercompany gain/loss associated with this stock sale? \n",
      "\n",
      "2) As of 12/31/00, Co. 102 shows no Investment in Subsidiary nor Equity Earnings balance relating to Co. 218. Should not there be a balance for Co. 218 which equals the USD equivalent of $8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars? Also, should not the Equity Earnings ($494,508.83) from Co. 218 posted on Co. 214 be posted on Co. 102?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) As of 12/31/00, Co. 218 shows capital stock of $1,760,000 owned by Co. 214. Should not this capital stock be shown to be owned by Co. 102?\n",
      "\n",
      "4) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 is showing a $6,000,000 entry in \"Other Deductions\" (The credit side of the journal entry hits \"Deferred Credits.\").  I need more detail concerning this amount. Could this be the consideration received from Co. 102 relating to the stock sale mentioned above?\n",

We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.

      "\n",
      "We have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onondaga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our interest in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by accounting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Billy's e-mail below basically states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, we should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last week, but then readjust the value of the asset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the \"receivable\" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment received) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q3.\n",
      "\n",

      "RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:   The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and Steve Walton from Enron will make a presentation on transmission planning and expansion.  Comments will be submitted to FERC in mid-November regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  In addition, the Commission stated that RTOs would not be required to begin on the Order No. 2000 start date of December 15, 2001; however, all public utilities are now required to commit by December 15, 2001 to join a FERC-approved RTO or lose their market based rate authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.  Comments are due late November.\n",
      "\n",
      "ICAP Inquiry:  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue.  Comments are due October 17.\n",
      "California Audit and West wide Price Cap Mitigation:  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.\n",
      "Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  \n",
      "Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and will require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Enron filed comments on October 5.\n",
      "California Refund Proceeding:  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.  Hearing will be held in mid-December.\n",
      "Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  We expect a Commission order shortly.  \n",
      "Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings by the end of October.  \n",
      "Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  Enron filed comments advocating a NE RTO based on the PJM congestion management system with a proposed start date of December 15, 2002 (PJM has proposed an implementation date of November 2003).  Commission action is expected on or before October 31.  \n",
      "Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission (advocating an independent transco structure for the RTO and an LMP/financial transmission rights congestion model).  Enron filed comments in support (and advocating a December 2002 start date).  Commission action is expected on or before October 31.  \n",
      "West -wide RTO Proceedings:  The Commission stated that it wants the proposed Desert Star RTO and RTO West to \"marry up\" into one RTO.  It appears that the Commission will treat California separately.  The Desert Star RTO has collapsed and the transmission owners are now proposing a \"transco\" structure.  Commission action is expected later this year.\n",
      "Interconnection proceeding:     The Commission is expected to address interconnection issues (with standardized procedures and agreements likely) at its meeting on October 11.  Enron has strongly advocated standardized procedures and will participate in the proceeding.\n",
      "Market Based Rate Authorization:  The Commission is expected to address procedures for qualifying to sell power at market based rates, which may include an assessment of localized generation in a particular region (\"supply margin assessment\").   The Commission is also considering adding tariff language that could make market based rates subject to refund upon date of a complaint or finding by FERC of market abuse.\n",

      "\n",
      "Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.\n",

      "Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee \"consumer\" confidence is not good.

      "\n",
      "Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.\n",

      "Message: I spoke with Seabrom Adamson and Kevin Wollenus (sp?) about a cost/benefit study.  Seab said that they are not set up to do a detailed modeling analysis, but that Tabors has the programs already set up and could probably do some type of a modeling analysis.  However, we discussed what other type of study we could do, and we came up with a few ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seab said that there are general benefits to RTO formation:  e.g., transmission expansion (although you still have siting problems, RTOs will build new transmission where it is needed); administrative cost savings; savings from reserve sharing.  We also discussed the arguments of the cheap power states.  For example, many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power.  But Seab points out that RTOs do not mean that the states \"lose\" their low cost power.  The PSCs retain their authority to decide whether their utilities can or cannot sell power from their plants to third parties.  The PSCs can prohibit utilities from exporting low cost power if it is needed to serve local retail customers.  Seab thought this response to a potential \"cost\" of RTOs could also be worked into the analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seab and Kevin are going to give the issue more thought and put together a proposal.  The problem is timing.  Seab has California testimony due on November 6 and he expects to be tied up with that for the next 2 weeks.  If we use the cost/benefit study as part of our NOPR comments (due end of Nov - mid Dec), then he will have enough time.  If we want to present a study before that time (perhaps with comments on RTO week), he will not be able to do the work.  Seab will have a proposal by COB tomorrow or perhaps Monday morning.\n",

The Commission has been approving these requests for licenses on a 90 day, provisional basis, pending a later determination of how or if they will modify the parental guarantee requirement. \n",

      "As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,\n",
      "here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under\n",
      "contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy\n",
      "replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed\n",
      "QF power with short-term firm energy?\n",
      "\n",
      "2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it\n",
      "has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market\n",
      "energy from sources over which it may have less control?\n",
      "\n",
      "3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in\n",
      "California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep\n",
      "is the supply curve for replacement energy?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the\n",
      "electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide\n",
      "on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes\n",
      "in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?\n",
      "\n",
      "6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF\n",
      "contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when\n",
      "the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as\n",
      "the QF buyouts done to date)?\n",
      "\n",
      "7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power\n",
      "procurement business?  If not, why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time\n",
      "for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.\n",

The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.

When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.  My immediate response, \"Actually, I needed some solo time.\"  Subject closed.  As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.\n",

Several weeks ago, we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do? \n",

This probably will not be the final as we will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies of our accounting requirements.\n",

The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.  It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.  I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.  It has a definite Austin vibe.  The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.  Oh well,  I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.\n",

      "You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already! \n",

We can get a smaller size Limo, one that seats 6 for $60/hr.  Here is the way they price it $60/hr plus 25% (4hour minium).  So, for 4hours the total is $300.  AND you get to drink for free, at least the hard liquor.  Beer and wine will need to be provided for by us.  Just an idea.  Call me later, (303) 575-6474.\n",

      "The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  \n",

Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just pointing and saying \"that will go over there\", etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told one of them, \"the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one\" and he laughed and said \"of course, you have the worst apartment i've ever moved\".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  \n",

Most people throw it away,  but not me.  I, for some reason,  feel like I might need it someday,  yet I have no idea what I have in these mystery boxes.  I'm sure your movers loved the obstacle course to get to your place.  They probably thought it was some kind of joke.  Thanks for the moving stories,  they were entertaining.  I have a visual of your building manager...pure comedy!  So when are you guys having the big house warming/  hot tub party?  It would be a good chance to cash in on some more scooby doo paraphenelia and house warming gifts.  Speaking of Scooby doo,  I'm sure Jai is loving the scooby phone.  I can see him not answering it until after a couple rings just so he can get the whole show. \n",

      "by Carole Martin\n",

      "[IMAGE]\t[IMAGE]\t\n",
      "\t[IMAGE]\t\n",
      "\n",
      "In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, \"Thanks, but no thanks.\"\n",
      "Great News; You've Got an Offer\n",
      "George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?\n",
      "It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.\n",
      "How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?\n",
      "Do What You Want\n",
      "The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. \"Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do,\" was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.\n",
      "When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. \"Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable,\" she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.\n",
      "Making the Call\n",
      "The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. \"I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position,\" he told the manager. \"I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future.\" The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.\n",
      "It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.\n",

Chairman and CEO\\n\\nPending confirmation\\n Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman\\n\\nAccording to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be \\nsubstituted. Also, there is a small possibility that\\nthe dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's \\nmeeting with President Clinton; they are still\\nworking on the final agenda. \\n \\n Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, \\nand will keep you posted of any \\nchanges; best regards,  jaime____\\n\",\n",
